App where I first practiced forEach, map, filter and reduce. HTML elements are mapped to create on page load from data stored in an array. There is implemented filtering logic based on category selected by user.

Project created during JavaScript tutorial of John Smilga. index.html and styles.css copied from the author. app.js created, studied and learned by me.
